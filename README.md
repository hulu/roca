# @hulu/roca

BrightScript unit testing.  No device required.

## Documentation

All of our documentation is at [hulu.github.io/roca](https://hulu.github.io/roca). If you'd prefer to view the raw markdown that powers the doc site, it's all in the [docs/](docs/) folder.

## Contributing

If you spot a bug or want a feature, please feel free to file an issue. If you want to contribute code yourself, simply fork the repo and open a PR.

### Modifying the docs site

We use [docsify](https://docsify.js.org) to build our site, and [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) to deploy it. To run the documentation site locally, simply run:
```shell
$ yarn serve-docs
```

Any changes you make to files in the `docs/` directory will cause the server to automatically reload the page.
