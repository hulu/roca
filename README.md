# @hulu/roca

BrightScript unit testing.  No device required.

## Getting Started
Note: All examples use `npm`, but these steps should be easily adapted to [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/), and many other JavaScript package managers.

### Install
Roca requires the [brs](https://github.com/sjbarag/brs/) runtime, which runs on [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).  If needed, initialize an NPM project with:

```bash
npm init
```

Then install `@hulu/roca` and `brs` as development dependencies with:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @hulu/roca brs
```

### Add NPM hook
To allow `npm test` to run your unit tests, simply call `roca` in your `package.json`'s "test" script:

```jsonc
{
    // ...
    scripts: {
        "test": "roca"
    }
}
```

### Directory Layout
Roca tests must be in a *sibling* of your existing `source/` and `components/` tree, like this:


```
.
├── components
│  ├── FooComponent.brs
│  └── FooComponent.xml
├── manifest
├── source
│  ├── main.brs
│  └── util.brs
└── tests
   ├── FooComponent.test.brs
   └── util.test.brs
```

Additionally, `roca` should be called from the same directory as your `manifest` file.  If you keep your entire source tree in a subdirectory, you'll want to `cd` into that before executing `roca`.

### Modify Channel Entry Point (if necessary)
Roca only supports a main channel entry point of `runUserInterface`, which helpfully avoids naming conflicts with the `main` functions used in `roca` and the individual test files.

Luckily `runUserInterface` is supported for all the same use-cases as `main`: https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/getting-started/architecture/dev-environment.md#sub-runuserinterface

### Adding a Test
Just like [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) tests are written in JavaScript, roca tests are written in BrightScript.  Roca will find and execute all files in the `./tests/` directory that match `*.test.brs`.  The smallest possible unit test must meet the following requirements:

1. A function called `main` that accepts one argument of type `object` and returns a value of type `object`
2. That `main` function initializes a Roca instance by passing the arguments from (1) into `roca()`.
3. That `main` function returns the return value of the `someRocaInstance.describe()` function
4. A test case declared with `m.it`
5. The test case passes or fails with `m.pass()`, `m.fail()`, or an assertion that calls one of those.

Put simply:

```brightscript
function main(args as object) as object
    return roca(args).describe("test suite", sub()
        m.it("has a test case", sub()
            m.pass()
        end sub)
    end sub)
end function
```

### Asserts

Similar to [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/api/assert/), `roca` offers an `assert` library, available via `m.assert`. It has the following methods:

- `m.assert.equal(actual, expected, errorMessage)`
- `m.assert.notEqual(actual, expected, errorMessage)`
- `m.assert.isTrue(value, errorMessage)`
- `m.assert.isFalse(value, errorMessage)`
- `m.assert.isInvalid(value, errorMessage)`

These methods will call `m.pass` or `m.fail` for you.

Usage:
```brightscript
function main(args as object) as object
    return roca(args).describe("test suite", sub()
        m.it("test case", sub()
            m.assert.equal("foo", "foo", "foo equals foo")
        end sub)
    end sub)
end function
```

### Output & CI Support
Roca exclusively reports its state via the [Test Anything Protocol](http://testanything.org/), and defaults to a Mocha-like "spec" output.  Failed tests cause the `roca` CLI to return a non-zero exit code, which allows most continuous integration systems to automatically detect pass/fail states.

#### CLI Options

| Option                  | Behavior       |
| ------------------------|----------------|
| `-h`/`--help`           | The help menu. |
| `-s`/`--source`         | Path to brs files (if different from source/) |
| `-R`/`--reporter`       | The mocha reporter to use, via [`tap-mocha-reporter`](https://github.com/tapjs/tap-mocha-reporter). See `--help` for options. |
| `-r`/`--require`        |  Path to a required setup file (will be run before unit tests) |
| `-f`/`--forbid-focused` | Fail if focused test or suite is detected. |

##### `-r`/`--require`
In order to enable custom unit test helper functions and/or unit test setup code, you can create a BrightScript file that will be run before any of your unit tests. Pass it to `roca` via the `-r`/`--require` flag.

For example, say you wanted to define a helper function that you could call in any of your unit tests:
```brs
' inside myProject/tests/MySetupFile.brs
function callMeAnywhere()
  return 123
end function
```

Then in your code, you'd have:
```brs
' inside myProject/tests/MyTestFile.test.brs
...
m.it("adds local and remote login buttons to page", sub()
    print callMeAnywhere() ' => 123
end sub)
```

And then you'd tell to `roca` to use the setup file:
```bash
roca -r "tests/MySetupFile.brs"
```

## API
### Global Functions
#### `roca(args = {} as object) as object`
Roca only has one global function &mdash; `roca` &mdash; used to initialize a new Roca test instance.  You probably want
to call it only once.

Parameters:
* `args = {} as object` - (optional) the set of arguments provided by the Roca test framework

Return value:
* the newly-created test framework as an associative array

Example:
```brightscript
function main(args as object) as object
    r = roca(args)
    print r    ' => an instance of roca
    return r
end sub
```

### The `roca` Object
Defining a test case matches the semantics of [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/), using `it` (or `fit` and `xit`) and `describe` functions accessible on the `m` scope within a suite.

#### `m.describe(description as string, func as object) as object`
Creates a new test suite that will contain test cases.  Note that there must always be one root suite, created by calling `describe()` directly on the result of `roca().

Parameters:
* `description as string` - a string describing the test case executed by `func`
* `func as object` - the function to execute as part of this test suite

Return value:
* the newly-created test suite as an associative-array, including test-pass state and test cases

Example:
```brightscript
function main(args as object) as object
    roca(args).describe("a test suite", sub()
        ' this function is executed when the suite is executed

        m.describe("a sub-suite", sub()
            m.describe("a sub-sub-suite", sub()
                ' sub-suites can be nested arbitrarily
            end sub)
        end sub)
    end sub)
end function
```

#### `m.it(description as string, func as object)`
Creates a test case with a given description.

Parameters:
* `description as string` - a string describing the test case executed by `func`
* `func as object` - the function to execute as part of this test case

Example:
```brightscript
m.it("a test case", sub()
    if 4 / 2 = 2 then
        m.pass()
    else
        m.fail()
    end if
end sub)
```

#### `m.fdescribe(description as string, func as object)`
Creates a focused test suite &mdash; a test suite that causes all non-focused tests *in all files* to be ignored.  Useful when debugging specific sets of unit tests.

Parameters:
* `description as string` - a string describing the test case executed by `func`
* `func as object` - the function to execute as part of this test case

Example:
```brightscript
m.describe("an unfocused test suite", sub()
    m.it("a test case", sub()
        ' this test won't run, because another suite is focused
    end sub)
end sub)

m.fdescribe("a focused test suite", sub()
    m.it("a test case inside of a focused suite", sub()
        ' this test *will* be executed, because it's inside a focused suite
    end sub)

    ' This sub-suite will run, because it's inside of a focused suite
    m.describe("a sub-suite", sub()
        m.it("a test case inside of the sub-suite", sub()
            ' this test *will* be executed, because it has focused ancestors
        end sub)
    end sub)
end sub)
```

#### `m.xdescribe(description as string, func as object)`
Creates a skipped unit test suite.  Any tests and sub-suites inside it will never execute.

Parameters:
* `description as string` - a string describing the test case executed by `func`
* `func as object` - the function to execute as part of this test case

Example:
```brightscript
m.xdescribe("an skipped test suite", sub()
    m.it("a test case", sub()
        ' this test will be skipped, because it's inside of a skipped suite
    end sub)

    ' This sub-suite will be skipped, because it's inside of a skipped suite
    m.describe("a sub-suite", sub()
        m.it("a test case inside of the sub-suite", sub()
            ' this test will be skipped, because it has skipped ancestors
        end sub)
    end sub)
end sub)
```

#### `m.fit(description as string, func as object)`
Creates a focused test case &mdash; a test case that causes all non-focused tests *in all files* to be skipped.  Useful when debugging specific unit tests.

Parameters:
* `description as string` - a string describing the test case executed by `func`
* `func as object` - the function to execute as part of this test case

Example:
```brightscript
m.it("a test case", sub()
    ' this test won't run, because another is focused
end sub)

m.fit("a focused test case", sub()
    ' this test *will* be executed, because it's focused
    if 1 + 1 = 3 then
        m.pass()
    else
        m.fail()
    end if
end sub)
```

#### `m.xit(description as string, func as object)`
Creates a skipped unit test case.  It will never execute.

Parameters:
* `description as string` - a string describing the test case executed by `func`
* `func as object` - the (skipped) function to execute as part of this test case

Example:
```brightscript
m.xit("a focused test case", sub()
    m.fail() ' this test will never be executed, so it doesn't matter if it's explicitly failed
end sub)
```

#### `m.log(value as dynamic)`
Prints a value to the console in a TAP-safe way.

Parameters:
* `value as dynamic` - the value to print to the console

Example:
```brightscript
m.it("prints diagnostic info", sub()
    m.log(someFunctionCall())
end sub)
```

#### `m.addContext(ctx as object)`
Provides context to cases in the form of extra fields.

- `ctx` should be a `roAssociativeArray`,
- `m.addContext` can be called multiple times,
- Context cascades into sub-suites.

Example:
```brightscript
m.addContext({
    aField: "value 1"
})

m.describe("a test suite with context", sub()
    m.addContext({
        aFn: function()
            return "value 2"
        end function
    })

    m.it("a test case", sub()
        m.assert.equal("value 1", m.aField, "Get context field")
        m.assert.equal("value 2", m.aFn(), "Use context function")
    end sub)
end sub)
```

### Within a Test Case
#### `m.pass()`
Marks a unit test as passing, overriding any previous "failed" states.

Example:
```brightscript
m.it("passes", sub()
    m.pass()
end sub)
```

#### `m.fail()`
Marks a unit test as failing, overriding any previous "passed" states.

Example:
```brightscript
m.it("fails", sub()
    m.fail()
end sub)
```
